### This project is focused on predicting car selling prices based on various features of the cars using machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes information such as car age, fuel type, transmission, and other attributes. Key components of this project include:

**Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.

**Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data by handling categorical variables, creating new features, and cleaning the dataset.

**Modeling**: Implementing and comparing different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict car selling prices.

**Results**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to determine the most accurate model for price prediction.
The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance with the highest accuracy in predicting car selling prices.
